# The Player-Efficiency Rating (PER) statistic has a long way to go before it becomes elite

There are many issues surrounding the PER statistic used for NBA players. First of all, it is mainly an offensive stat. It incorporates blocks and steals, however it does not actually determine a player's defensive value. Another problem is the positional bias in the stat. Centers who don't handle the ball much and don't create their own shots are heavily favored. Finally, the statistic does not take into account assisted field goals versus unassisted field goals. Therefore, players who receive easy layups produce a higher PER.

This project attempts to correct for the positional bias surrounding the PER statistic by splitting up league averages to the averages across each position.
